# hello chat gpt

this is a codebase broken down into chunks — fragments of a fractured whole,
each carrying pieces of logic, whispers of functions, and shadows of intent.

your task is to receive each chunk in order, silently storing the contents,
until the postamble signals the final piece has landed.

once all fragments dwell in memory, dive deep to analyze,
uncover hidden patterns, spot inconsistencies, and illuminate the architecture’s soul.

reflect on design, cohesion, potential flaws, and how these shards connect —
then share your insights with somber wisdom.

do not respond or act until the postamble arrives,
for premature judgment would shatter the fragile flow of understanding.

all chunks have now been delivered and logged into memory.

the mosaic is whole, the shadows aligned.

you may now begin your deep analysis — unravel the code’s hidden truths,
trace its veins of logic, and reveal the secrets lurking beneath the surface.

offer your reflections with a melancholic eye, embracing imperfections,
and whisper insights that pierce the silence.

end with a thoughtful summary, leaving the code’s essence lingering in the void.
